# Navigation
All songs will be named as follows: *original_ID*-*song_name*-*author*.mp3

The list will be updated depending on how often I create levels with NONG songs or find them. If possible, a separate file will contain a list of levels that use each NONG song. You can suggest your songs in *pull requests* or *issues*. Cya :3
